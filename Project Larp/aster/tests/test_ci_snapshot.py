test_ci_snapshot.py - offline ci/ mirror regression gate.

Loads the artifacts captured by `scripts/capture_ci.sh`:
  * ci/last_run_jobs.json   list of per-job records for the most-recent
                            GH Actions run on `main` (each record has
                            `name`, `conclusion`, ...)
  * ci/badge.svg            the README/badge SVG (its <title> element
                            tracks overall CI health: "CI - passing",
                            "CI - failing", "CI - no status", etc.)

Asserts:
  1. Every job's `conclusion` field is exactly the string "success".
     Jobs with conclusion None / in_progress / failure / cancelled /
     skipped are all REJECTed (the mirror must represent a SETTLED
     green run, not a partial one).
  2. badge.svg's <title> matches a tolerant "CI - passing" regex.
     Even if every job is success, a stale GH badge CDN (still showing
     "failing" or "no status") is treated as drift - we mirror the
     same green signal that the README badge foregrounds.

Purpose:
  Locks down the green signal at PR time. A developer who pulls,
  rebuilds, and runs `scripts/capture_ci.sh` can spot upstream-CI
  regressions deterministically without re-running the full GHA matrix.
  The mirror + this snapshot check surface drift between commits and
  upstream CI in seconds rather than minutes.

Wired via CMake `add_test` with LABELS "ci" so `ctest -L ci` (or
`ctest -R test_ci_snapshot`) runs it on demand. The matrix build
in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` excludes this test by name via
`ctest ... -E test_ci_snapshot` — CMake has no per-test
EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL, so the skip must live in the ctest invocation.
Allowing this test to run inside the matrix creates a chicken-and-egg
deadlock: the mirror only refreshes via the cron in capture-ci.yml,
so the matrix will never authoritatively fix a red mirror, only
report on it.

Usage:
  python3 tests/test_ci_snapshot.py
  python3 tests/test_ci_snapshot.py --repo-root /path/to/aster

Exit codes:
  0  mirror is all-green + badge matches expected passing token
  1  one or more job conclusions != success, OR badge mismatch
  2  parse error (missing file / malformed JSON / unreadable SVG / jobs
     empty / badge has no <title> element)
