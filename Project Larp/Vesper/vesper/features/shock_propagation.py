"""Graph shock propagation engine.

Implements a 1-step, row-normalised network diffusion algorithm that maps a
*direct* per-ticker shock (the NLP-decay risk score, in ``[0, 1]``) onto the
rest of the universe.

Edge semantics:
    A directed edge ``supplier -> customer`` with weight ``w`` means that the
    supplier accounts for a fraction ``w`` of the customer's revenue. We
    treat that as the *channel* along which a text-shock at the supplier
    flows to the customer; the propagated received shock at the customer is
    therefore the in-edge-weighted sum of upstream direct shocks.

Concretely, let ``A`` be the (sparse) adjacency matrix whose rows are the
*supplier* nodes and whose columns are the *customer* nodes. We row-normalise
so a supplier's outflow weights sum to at most 1 (this prevents path
amplification in graphs with density > 1/n). The received shock at every
customer is then::

    propagated = (A_norm.T) @ direct_shock

Because this is a 1-step operator, **cycles cannot cause shocks to amplify
indefinitely** — we compute a *single* application of ``A_norm.T`` per call.
For multi-hop propagation compose ``A_norm`` powers explicitly upstream.
