# Vesper — Alternative Data Information Arbitrage Signal Engine

[![CI](https://github.com/shrxvxn007/Vesper/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shrxvxn007/Vesper/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Vesper is a modular, production-grade Python framework for **mid-frequency
statistical arbitrage** built around alternative-data signals. It produces a
weekly cross-sectional alpha score from SEC filings and a synthetic supply-
chain graph, then runs an institutional-grade convex portfolio allocator.

> **Note on the Pages badge:** GitHub Pages is not enabled on this repo yet.
> The `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow is gated on
> `github.event.repository.has_pages` and correctly stays in the
> `skipped` state until Pages is enabled. The Pages workflow badge is
> omitted from this README because GitHub caches the badge SVG against
> the most recent *failed* run (the failures pre-date the `has_pages`
> gate) and shows "failing" until a *successful* deploy occurs. The
> badge will be re-added after Pages is enabled (Settings → Pages →
> Source = "GitHub Actions") and the first successful deploy lands.

## Features

- **SEC EDGAR ingestion** with a SEC-compliant `User-Agent` (offline by
  default; see `vesper/data_pipeline/sec_scraper.py`).
- **MD&A extraction** for 10-Q (Item 2) and 10-K (Item 7) via BeautifulSoup
  with regex-anchored heading detection (`vesper/data_pipeline/mda_parser.py`).
- **Information-decay factor** computed on top of TF-IDF cosine similarity
  between consecutive quarterly filings (`vesper/features/nlp_decay.py`).
- **Graph shock propagation** — row-normalised 1-step directed diffusion
  across the customer/supplier graph (`vesper/features/shock_propagation.py`).
- **Idiosyncratic-return targets** via rolling-window OLS residuals
  (`vesper/alpha_model/target_formulation.py`).
- **PurgedGroupTimeSeriesSplit** + L2-regularised Ridge for the alpha model
  (`vesper/alpha_model/cross_sectional_model.py`).
- **Sector factor neutralization** via OLS-residualisation
  (`vesper/portfolio/factor_neutralization.py`).
- **Convex allocator** with cvxpy: $-neutral, $-neutral, ±3% per-name caps
  and linear transaction-cost penalty (`vesper/portfolio/convex_optimizer.py`).
- **Deterministic synthetic data generator** so the framework runs
  end-to-end out of the box without hitting SEC
  (`vesper/scripts/synthetic_generator.py`).
- **Unit + integration tests** covering all math invariants
  (`tests/`).

## Quick start

```bash
# Recommended: create a virtual environment first.
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install runtime + test dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the full backtest end-to-end on synthetic data.
python -m vesper.main --data-dir data

# Run the test suite.
pytest tests -v
```

`main.py` will (re)generate the synthetic universe under `data/` if it
doesn't already exist. The generator is seeded (`np.random.default_rng(42)`)
so re-runs are byte-stable.

## Anti-trapping controls

- **Lookahead firewall.** Filings are keyed by `release_date` (public
  availability), not `period_end_date`. Weekly features use `merge_asof` with
  `direction="backward"` — strictly no-future information.
- **Survivorship hooks.** The supply-chain graph carries
  `point_in_time_universe` / `constituents_as_of` metadata and
  `vesper.main` filters the tradable universe against that set on every
  weekly rebalance (replace with a true historical source if you go live).
- **Execution realism.** Hardcoded borrow cost and bid-ask slippage defaults
  live in `TransactionCostConfig` and are applied to PnL via
  `apply_costs_to_pnl` — never silently zero.

## Testing

Run the zero-network test suite:

```bash
pytest tests -v
```

The integration test (`tests/test_integration.py`) drives `vesper.main` against
the synthetic generator and asserts:

- `sum(weights) == 0`  (dollar-neutrality, to 1e-6)
- `weights @ beta == 0` (beta-neutrality, to 1e-6)
- `|weight| <= 0.03` per name
- All PnL numbers are finite
- No raw returns are used as targets anywhere

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push to `main` and on every pull
request. The single CI job:

1. Sets up Python 3.11 with pip caching.
2. Installs `requirements.txt`.
3. Runs `pytest tests -v` (the `network` marker is skipped by default).
4. Runs `python -m vesper.main --data-dir data` end-to-end.
5. Re-asserts `dollar_neutrality_violation < 1e-6` and
   `max_gross_weight <= 0.0301` directly from the persisted
   `data/backtest_diagnostics.txt`, so the invariants are enforced even if
   the test fixtures are refactored.
6. Executes `notebooks/evaluation.ipynb` headlessly and uploads the
   resulting PNGs + `.ipynb` as the `evaluation-notebook` artefact for
   visual diff review.
7. Uploads `backtest_diagnostics.txt` as the `backtest-diagnostics`
   artefact.

The network smoke test (`test_edgar_rate_limit_smoke`) is **not** run by
CI — opt in locally with `pytest -m network -v` after exporting
`VESPER_SEC_USER_AGENT`.

## Static HTML export + GitHub Pages

`docs/evaluation.html` and `docs/cap_binding_diagnostics.html` are static
exports of the two notebooks with all charts embedded as base64 PNGs.
You can browse them:

* directly from the repo: open the `docs/*.html` files on `github.com`
  (renders as text in the web UI; download for offline viewing), or
* live via **GitHub Pages** once Pages is enabled (see below).

### Manual Pages setup (one-time)

GitHub Pages is **not** enabled by default on this repo. The
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow is gated on
`github.event.repository.has_pages` so it stays a no-op until Pages is
turned on. To enable:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** for this repository.
2. Under **Source**, choose **GitHub Actions**.
3. Click save. The next push to `main` will trigger the Pages workflow.

The live site URL will be of the form
`https://<owner>.github.io/Vesper/evaluation.html` (plus
`cap_binding_diagnostics.html`). Until Pages is enabled, the committed
`docs/*.html` files are the fallback view.
